What is chocolate meat? Not only is it a delicious Filipino dish it is now also a Mephisto theme! For blogging developers, it uses a modified version of the "lazy" TextMate syntax highlighting theme (via Ultraviolet). Check out "my last post":http://theezpzway.com/2009/3/8/how-to-integrate-ultraviolet-into-mephisto to see the syntax highlighting in action (this blog is using Chocolate Meat)

Tried and tested on Mephisto 0.8. Anything else is unknown territory.
